# GUI Traversal of Multiple Search Algorithms Using N-Tier Architecture (Learnify)
Graphical Representation of Multiple Search Algorithms (implemented in Prolog) using Windows Form having N-Tier Architecture

## Searching Algorithms
The list of algorthms implemented in this app are:  <br /> <br />
**•	Breadth First Search. <br />
•	Best First Search.<br />
•	Iterative Deepening Search.<br />
•	Map Coloring (CSP).<br />
•	A\* Search.**

## Purpose

This is one of proposed solutions that can be used by many students who are in the field of computer science and finding it difficult to understand the different searching techniques used in Artificial Intelligence. In order to get good support from the users we a program should be able to effectively convey the way a search works. Therefore, to generate the best customer services, the program should be more effective and efficient. By computerizing the manual system and searches, the understanding of the searches can become more effective and a good performance of services might be increased.

## Scope 

Learnify is a standalone system. The scope of this software is that this computerized learning system is for students to understand searching methodologies and path to a desired goal. There are five search algorithms traversals in this program i.e. Breadth First Search, Best First Search, Iterative Deepening Search, Constraint Satisfaction Problem, and A* Search. Breadth First Search and Iterative Deepening Search come under the category of uninformed search, A* and Best First Search are types of informed search where search is performed with some knowledge of the goal, Constraint Satisfaction Problem is beyond classical search and it works in a graph domain with some predefined constraints – in our project we are working with graph coloring domain .

## Goals

The main benefits are: <br />
•	App will help users to understand the search technique with user friendly interface. <br />
•	Users will be able to find a goal no matter how large the search space is. <br />
•	Program will not only tell the path to goal but it will also tell the search order that how many nodes were traversed before actually finding the goal. <br />
•	Users can input the graph according to their requirement and apply operation. <br />

## Requirement Specifications
The effectiveness and efficiency of the program are the requirements of the system architecture for this system. This section specifies the tools which are required for this application to run or if you desire to design a similar application like this, the system requirements are: <br /> <br />
**•	SWI Prolog <br />
•	Visual Studio 2017 C# <br />
•	Visual Studio 2017 Windows Form <br />
•	Microsoft Graph Layout <br />
•	Notepad++ <br />**
